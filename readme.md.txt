# Intelligent Data Quality Monitoring for Regulatory Reporting

This project implements a hybrid data quality monitoring framework for
financial regulatory reporting systems (PRA / ECB).

Pipeline:
1. Rule-based Data Quality Engine
2. Machine Learning anomaly detection (Isolation Forest + Autoencoder)
3. Unified anomaly scoring
4. Dashboard visualisation

Technology:
- Python, Scikit-learn
- Autoencoders (Deep Learning)
- SHAP explainability
- Streamlit dashboard

This project is part of the M.Tech AIML dissertation at BITS Pilani (WILP).
